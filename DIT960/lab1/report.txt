Insertion is definatley better at array sizes under 100. 
If you have an unmutable structure then the only algorithm 
you can use is mergesort. The more sorted the data is the 
better insertion is. 

For random large arrays Quicksort is faster then Mergesort
because Quicksort have less overhead than Mergesort (Quicksort 
is inplace and doesn't need to construct new arrays, for example).

Insertionsort is very quick on sorted lists because at each element 
it compares only once to see if the element is in the right order, 
thus only taking O(n) time.

Insertionsort should be avoided when the 
structure is longer than 100 and you are sure its not 
nearly sorted.
