Insertion is definatley better at array sizes under 100. 
If you have an unmutable structure then the only algorithm 
you can use is mergesort. The more sorted the data is the 
better insertion is. 

If data is unknown (including length) mergesort is the 
better choice, unless memory is limited. Then you should 
use quicksort. Insertionsort should be avoided when the 
structure is longer than 100 and you are sure its not 
nearly sorted.
